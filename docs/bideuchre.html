    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    
    <p>
        Welcome to Bid Euchre.
    </p>
    
    <h4>What's Bid Euchre?</h4>
    
    <p>
        Bid Euchre is a variation on the classic game of Euchre played all over
        the world. It's primarily played in the midwestern United States, and
        the particular version implemented here in Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can find the rules in <a href="rules.html">rules.html</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How to Play Bid Euchre</h4>
    
    <p>
        Using the program should be fairly straightforward, assuming you know
        how to play our version of Bid Euchre. If not, see
        <a href="rules.html">rules.html</a>.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Starting a Game</h4>
    
    <p>
        Select New Game from the File menu. You can start a new game even if one
        has already begun, but you will lose the old game. When starting a new
        game, it will ask for your name.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Quitting</h4>
    
    <p>
        To quit the program, simply select Exit from the File menu.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Cheat Mode</h4>
    
    <p>
        More of a debugging tool than intended for actual play, but you can
        select Cheat Mode from the Options menu to enter Cheat Mode. In Cheat
        Mode, you can see all the other players cards.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Playing against the computer</h4>
    
    <p>
        The game is played with 6 players, 1 human and 5 computer. When it is
        time for you to do something (play or bid), the display will notify
        you, either by popping up the bid dialog, or by writing a message in
        the middle of the display.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Playing with/against friends over the internet</h4>
    
    <p>
        This is not currently implemented. It is planed for a future version.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How to Play</h4>
    
    <p>
        Playing is done by clicking on your cards. Simply click the card you
        wish to play.
    </p>
    
    <h4>Signal Play</h4>
    
    <p>
        You can send signals to your friends by holding the shift key while you
        click the mouse on your card. The card will be drawn at a slight angle
        to indicate it is a signal. Signals are a way of telling partners what
        suit to lead back. Note that computer players currently do not
        understand signals and will not play to them.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How to Bid</h4>
    
    <p>
        Bidding is done with the bid dialog. When it pops up, you can select
        the number of tricks you wish to bid and the suit in which to bid them.
        Press the Bid button to make a Bid, or the Pass button to pass. If you
        close the dialog, it will be interpreted as a pass.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        In a 'best' bid, you will be given two cards by the AI, then asked to
        make two discards. You can discard by clicking on your cards, same as
        playing.
