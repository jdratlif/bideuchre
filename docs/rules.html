    <h2>How to Play Bid Euchre</h2>
    
    <blockquote>
        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        
        <p>
            Bid Euchre is a variation on the card game Euchre. There are many
            versions of Bid Euchre. This document describes the rules used to
            play one of these versions. Our version is known to be played in
            Bloomington, Indiana, USA.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Basic</h4>
        
        <p>
            Bid Euchre consists of six players in teams of three. Team members
            are seated alternately so that each person is seated beside an
            opponent.

            Cards are dealt evenly to each player, and the deck used is a double
            Euchre deck, also known as a Pinochle deck. This includes four suits
            (Spades, Diamonds, Clubs, and Hearts) of each face (9, 10, Jack,
            Queen, King, Ace). Since we use a double deck, there is a duplicate
            of each card. Each player received 8 cards. There is no 'correct'
            way of dealing, but the program will always deal 3 cards, then
            a second three, then a final two to each player. Dealing is
            clockwise starting with the player to the left of the dealer and
            ending with the dealer his/herself.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Bidding</h4>
        
        <p>
            At the beginning of each round of play (after the cards are dealt),
            the players begin a round of bidding for the trump suit and number
            of tricks. Starting to the left of the dealer, each player makes
            a bid. Bids consist of a number of tricks (1-8), and a suit (i.e. 4
            Spades). No-trump bids are also permissible, with the cards being
            ace-high or ace-low. So a bid may be 3 Low or 5 High, for example.
            A final kind of Bid is the 'Best' bid. In this Bid, the bidder asks
            his/her partners for their 'best' of a certain trump (no-trump also
            being permissible). Each partner gives one card to the bidder, their
            'best' in the declared trump (or no-trump). The partners of the
            'best' bidder do not participate in the following round. The bidder
            must get all 8 tricks without any assistance from the partners save
            the single card they gave. A player may pass if he/she does not wish
            to make a bid. Bidding ends either when a player makes a 'best' bid,
            or when the dealer has bid or pass. Each bid must surpass the
            previous bids in number of tricks. If someone has bid 3 tricks, the
            subsequent players must bid at least 4 or pass. A bid of 8 tricks
            can only be surpassed by a 'best' bid.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Trick Play</h4>
        
        <p>
            The player who made the bid leads the first trick. Subsequent tricks
            are led by the person who captured the previous trick. Tricks are
            captured by playing the highest card on the trick. In no-trump ace
            high, or a suited trump, the cards are ordered from ace being the
            highest card, to nine being the lowest. Suit is important in two
            ways. First, the lowest trump card is higher than any non-trump
            card. This means a nine of the trump suit is always higher than the
            ace of any other suit. The jacks are also special when trump is
            declared. The jack of the trump suit is the highest card, and is
            called the Right Bower. The jack of the suit which matches the
            color of the trump suit (spades/clubs and diamonds/hearts) is called
            the Left Bower, and is the second highest card. When playing
            non-trump cards, the Ace is only highest if it matches the lead
            card's suit. In other words, if the lead card is the king of clubs,
            only the ace of clubs is higher. Players must follow the lead card
            suit if they have it, otherwise they may play as they wish. When
            no-trump ace low is bid, nines are the highest card and aces are
            lowest. Finally, since we are playing with a double-deck, the first
            played card is always higher than its duplicate.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Scoring</h4>
        
        <p>
            A team scores points by capturing tricks. The bidding team must
            capture minimally the number of tricks they bid, otherwise they are
            'euchred'. If the bidding team is 'euchred', they lose points equal
            to the number of tricks they bid. If they are not 'euchred', they
            earn points equal to the number of tricks captured. The opposing
            team always earns points equal to the number of tricks captured. In
            addition to tricks, 'best' bids come with an 8 point bonus if you
            make them, or an 8 point penalty if you get 'euchred'.
        </p>
        
        <h4>Winning</h4>
        
        <p>
            A team wins by reaching 54 points. Since both teams can earn points,
            if both teams reach 54 points simultaneously, the winning team is
            the one who made the bid. Conversely, if a team gets 54 points 'in
            the hole' (-54 points by being euchred), they lose automatically.
